## Props in React

Props are readonly, immutable means we can use them but not change. We can change the props but it is not a good practice to make any changes in props after using it.

## State in React

State are mutable means we can use and change them according to situation. We can change the states after using it.

Note: Either the props change, or state change our whole component will be re render to check/apply/show changes.
